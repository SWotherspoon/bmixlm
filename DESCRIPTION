Description: Fit a binary mixture of linear models by Gibbs sampling.  
    Assumes responses are drawn two subpopulations, each described by a
    different linear model, and it is unknown which responses are drawn
    from which subpopulation.  The mixture model estimates the
    coefficient of the two subpopulation models and the probability
    that an observation is drawn from a particular subpopulation.
